Searching for wisdom...

The goal of this project is to push the limits of ML and create a philosophical model that can answer some of humanity's deepest and most controversial questions. In answering these questions, we hope to get closer to wisdom and truth.

We will place an emphasis on logical reasoning: starting from fundamental axioms and reasoning to a final conclusion. We'll then create a visual representation of the sequential logical steps the model took to reach its conclusion.
